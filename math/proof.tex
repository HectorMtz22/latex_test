    \section*{Problem}
    Let $f$ be a three times differentiable function (defined on $\mathbb{R}$
    and real-valued) such that $f$ has at least five distinct real zeros. 
    Prove that $f + 6f' + 12f'' + 8f'''$ has at least two distinct real zeros.

    \section*{Polynomial Function}
    A polynomial is generally represented as $P(x)$. The highest power of the variable of $P(x)$ is known as its degree. Degree of a polynomial function is very important as it tells us about the behaviour of the function $P(x)$ when x becomes very large, and also helps us to know the number of roots that we can have in a function. The domain of a polynomial function is entire real numbers $\mathbb{R} $.

    \section*{Rolle's Thorem}
    Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $]a, b[$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$. Then there exists $c \in ]a, b[ $ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

    \section*{Hint}
    Use $g : x \rightarrow  e^ {\alpha x} $

    \section*{Rolle's Theorem}

    $$ 
    \int_a^bf(x)dx
    $$
