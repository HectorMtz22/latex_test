    \section*{Problem}
    Let $f$ be a three times differentiable function (defined on $\mathbb{R}$
    and real-valued) such that $f$ has at least five distinct real zeros. 
    Prove that $f + 6f' + 12f'' + 8f'''$ has at least two distinct real zeros.

    \section*{Polynomial Function}
    A polynomial is generally represented as $P(x)$. The highest power of the variable of $P(x)$ is known as its degree. Degree of a polynomial function is very important as it tells us about the behaviour of the function $P(x)$ when x becomes very large, and also helps us to know the number of roots that we can have in a function. The domain of a polynomial function is entire real numbers $\mathbb{R} $.

    \section*{Rolle's Thorem}
    Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $]a, b[$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$. Then there exists $c \in ]a, b[ $ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

    This theorem will be admitted because its proof requires results which are not seen in this course. If $f$ is the constant function, the result is obvious. Otherwise, since $f$ is continuous over $[a, b]$, $f$ is bounded over $[a, b]$
    and reaches its bounds. This means that there exists $m \in  [a, b] $ and $M \in  [a, b] $ such that $\forall x \in  [a, b]$, $f(m) \leqslant  f(x) \leqslant f(M) (f(m) \neq  f(M)$ because $f$ is not a constant function$)$. As $f(a) = f(b)$, then we have the following cases:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item if $m = a$ or $m = b$, then $M \in  ]a, b[$, hence we have $c = M$;
        \item if $M = a$ or $M = b$, then $m \in  ]a, b[$, hence we have $c = m$;
        \item $m \in  ]a, b[$ and $M \in  ]a, b[$, hence we have $c = m$ or $c = M$.
    \end{enumerate}
    }

    So in all cases $f$ admits a local extremum at a point $c$ of $]a, b[$ and is differentiable on $]a, b[$, hence, according to the proposition 22, $f'(c) = 0$.

    Use $g : x \rightarrow  e^ {\alpha x} $
